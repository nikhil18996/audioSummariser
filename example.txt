Climate change occurs when changes in Earth's climate system result in new weather patterns that last for at least a few decades and maybe for millions of years. The climate system is comprised of five interacting parts the atmosphere hydrosphere biosphere biosphere lithosphere, the climate system receives nearly all of its energy from the Sun in a relatively tiny amount from Earth's interior, the climate system also gives off energy to outer space the balance of incoming and outgoing energy and the passage of the energy through the climate system determines Earth's energy budget when the incoming energy is greater than the outgoing energy Earth's energy budget is positive and the climate system is warming if more energy goes out the energy budget is negative and Earth experiences cooling as this energy moves through the earth's climate system. It creates Earth's weather and lung.Turn averages of weather are called climate changes in the long-term average are called climate change. Such changes can be the result of internal variability with natural processes in here on to the various parts of the climate system. Older Earth's energy budget examples include cyclical ocean patterns such as the well-known El nino-southern oscillation and less familiar Pacific decadal oscillation and Atlantic multidecadal oscillation climate change can also result from external forcing one events outside of the climate systems five parts, not unless produce changes within the system examples include changes and solar output on volcanism human activities can also change Earth's climate and are presently driving climate change through global warming. There is no General agreement in scientific Media or policy documents as to the precise turn to be used to refer to anthropogenic force change. Either global warming or climate change may be used.
